# Customer Segmentation & Churn Risk Analysis Using RFM-Based (EDA)
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce transactional dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify high-value and at-risk customers, and support churn prediction using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features.

## Problem Statement

The e-commerce business operates on a large volume of transactional data but lacks a systematic, data-driven understanding of customer value and retention risk. Currently, the business is unable to clearly identify:

* Customers who consistently contribute the highest revenue
* Customers showing early signs of churn based on declining engagement
* How purchasing behavior differs across recency, frequency, and monetary value

As a result, marketing and retention strategies are one-size-fits-all, leading to inefficient use of promotional budgets, missed upselling opportunities, and delayed churn intervention.

To address this, the business requires a structured customer segmentation framework using transactional behavior (RFM metrics) to:

* Differentiate high-value, loyal, and churn-prone customers
* Enable targeted marketing and retention actions
* Support early churn detection before revenue loss occurs

This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis combined with RFM-based segmentation to transform raw transaction data into actionable customer intelligence.

## Business Objectives

* Understand customer purchasing behavior using transaction-level data

* Segment customers using RFM quantile rankings

* Identify high-value and loyal customers for retention and upselling

* Detect churn-risk customers based on recency and frequency patterns

* Provide actionable insights for marketing and customer engagement strategies

## Analytical Approach

* Data cleaning & preprocessing

* Univariate analysis to understand distributions and outliers

* Bivariate & multivariate analysis to identify relationships

* RFM feature engineering using quantiles

* Customer segmentation based on RFM scores

* Churn vs non-churn behavior comparison
